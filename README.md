Tool to make music using pictures through edge detection

just for reference,

So I think what we'd want is edge detection that returns a black and white image
And then we can read the image column by column and play notes where rows represent different notes
We could also cheat a lil to make it actually sound nice by reading bands column by column where bands are like 12rows or something
Then we can define a tuning consisting of 12 notes
And read band by band
